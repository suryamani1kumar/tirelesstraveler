While browsing through this volume, please keep in mind that                photographs of not all the countries or dominions visited by                me across the seven continents are featured in this book.                However, we have tried our best to provide a representative                view of my favorite locations and reminiscences from one                hundred and thirteen countries.                                                                                                                                Introduction    11","For me, traveling is a therapeutic experience. The more I                          travel, the more I learn about different places, people, history,                          culture, food, customs and so many other things that are                          unique from one place to another.                           However, even after being to all the countries in the world,                          I feel that I have probably not seen one-percent of what                          there is to see. One lifetime is not enough to see or witness                          everything that our beautiful planet has to offer.                           I see myself as an explorer, hence at the end of a long day of                          journey, sightseeing or adventure - all I seek is a clean bed                          and a hot shower. I prefer home-stays and boutique hotels or                          places that are less popular with tourists. Besides spending                          several nights in tents and tribal huts, I have also slept under                          open skies. My most valuable travel resource are local people,                          who are generally very hospitable, provided one is respectful                          towards their culture and tradition.                           I have flown over three million miles on various airlines, which                          is equivalent of more than a hundred and twenty trips around                          the Earth - at the Equator. I can add another million miles to this                          tally by including the total travel distance of over fifty cruises                          which have transcended continents, oceans or both. During                          my six expeditions to Antarctica, the Arctic region, North and                          South Poles, besides using a diverse variety of air-transport                          and sea-vessels including lifeboats, I have ridden dog-sleds                          and trekked on foot. I once hopped onto an overnight freight                          train that was headed for the Islamic Republic of Mauritania,                          in the northwest corner of Africa. On another day and place,                          I ensconced myself in an open wagon train carrying iron ore.                          Besides crossing the Indo-Bhutan border on a motorcycle in                          the early-seventies, I have experienced every possible animal                          ride or animal aided transport used in the world.                           I plan trips within a matter of days. I have never used or felt                          the need of a travel agent and carry-out a lot of self-research                          - chiefly through books and the Internet. However, these do                          not completely eliminate the chances of surprises - which                          I have encountered in plenty.                            Antarctica and the Arctic are unquestionably the most                          pristine and dazzling locations  on  our  planet  -  with  their                          glaciers, blinding snow glare and biting temperatures. Africa                          is my all-time favorite continent because, besides unmatched                          warmth from its people, it radiates unrivaled natural beauty.                          Asia offers unrivaled variety across every aspect of nature,      An egg balancing on a nail-head due to no gravity at the Equator. | On a                          human civilization, flora and fauna.

Shah  Jahan  was  confined  to                the far end of Agra Fort, which besides river Yamuna, also                overlooks the rear portion of the Taj.                  While supervising the construction of the Taj, Shah Jahan                would never have imagined that the last years of his life                would be spent not gazing at the majestic front-risings                or the exquisite side-view of the magnificent tomb of his                beloved wife, but staring at the posterior of the building that                he had so lovingly created. After his death, Shah Jahan was                buried in the same tomb, right next to his wife’s grave.                 Aurangzeb’s reign perpetuated the culture of religious                intolerance  and  excessive  cruelty.  Early  headwinds  of                British colonialism and upsurge of several local Indian rulers                heralded the decline of the mighty Mughal empire shortly                after the dawn of the eighteenth century, which for six                generations provided the Indian subcontinent with several                architectural edifices.

Amongst                        the seven wonders of the world is the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is visited by millions of tourists from all over the world every year.

Its government recognizes nearly eighty-six ethnic                        groups and tribes. Some of the smaller tribes have less than ten thousand members.                     The Bumi tribe of Ethiopia are known to be fierce fighters. Scarification is practiced by both                    men and women. While women do it to beautify themselves, in men scars signify the number                    of kills. The process of scarification is both interesting and painful. When a person is lashed                    with a whip made of bull’s hide, it leaves a deep scar. That part of the body is then applied with                         cow-dung. A few days later, while the wound subsides, a prominent scar emerges.                    On reaching the age of puberty, women of the Mursi tribe, residing around Mago National Park                    in the Omo valley, wear large plates on their lower lips. This custom is linked to eligibility for                    marriage and chastity to her partner. The plate is removed only after the death of her husband.                                                66   The Tireless Traveler","Ethiopia                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Africa   67","Gabon | Gambia                                                        In Gabon, I came across a biker who                    was perhaps carrying more weight                    and volume than what a mid-sized                    truck would be legally allowed to                           transport in Europe.

It is the meeting point                    of the blue Nile and the white Nile in the capital city - Khartoum. The blue one originates in                    Ethiopia while the white one flows from Lake Victoria; and together they form the Nile river                                             which is the longest in the world.                     Sudan is a country of contrasts. In the cities, there is affluence as well as stark poverty. In remote                    areas, most tribes follow age old customs and are not willing to assimilate in the mainstream.                    The Mundari, is a small ethnic group of south Sudan, which consists of cattle-herders and                    agriculturists. Generosity is highly valued in this tribe and there are penalties for being mean,                        greedy and parsimonious. They believe annoyance and grumbling will make them sick.                     Other than Egypt, Sudan is the only other country in the world to have Pyramids - some of                    which were built between 650 and 300 BC. Sudanese Pyramids are known as Nubian Pyramids.

The Dome of the Rock is an Islamic shrine (next to the church) at the center of the                      Al-Aqsa Mosque compound on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is the                      world’s oldest surviving work of Islamic architecture, the earliest archaeologically                      attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler, and its inscriptions contain                           the earliest epigraphic-proclamations of Islam and Prophet Muhammad.                       The Western Wall - also known as the Wailing Wall (below the mosque), is a portion                      of an ancient limestone wall in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is part of the larger                      wall known to Jews and Christians, as Temple Mount. A little over half the wall’s                      total height, including its seventeen courses located below street level, date back to                      the Second Temple period and are believed to have been started during Herod the                      Great’s rule. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, and                      the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad                      period. The smaller stones of the uppermost courses are from the Ottoman period.                       In the image above, Christian pilgrims are seen marching through the ancient stone                      alleys of the Jerusalem’s old city, retracing Jesus Christ’s path to crucification in                                             observation of Good Friday.                       The image on the right shows Jews participating in Sukkot - a week-long holiday that                      celebrates the fall harvest.

The Nabataean city of Petra is a man-made wonder on this planet. It dates back two thousand years. The journey into Petra starts through                      a very narrow gorge, about a kilometer in length, flanked on both sides by towering seventy meter high rock walls. The gorge opens in front                      of the Treasury (Khazneh) building, with its massive facade carved into the solid rock face. Petra was an important junction for silk, spice                      and other trade routes that linked China, India, and southern Arabia with Egypt, Syria, Greece and Rome. The Nabataean kingdom existed                      for centuries and Petra was widely admired for its refined culture, massive architecture and ingenious complex of dams and water channels,                      before its annexation by the Roman Emperor Trajan. By the fourteenth century, Petra was completely lost to the world, and it remained so                      for almost three hundred years; until 1812, when a Swiss traveler, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, persuaded his guide to take him to the site of                                                                        the rumored lost city.

The physical contest between                     a bull and bullfighter, in which the latter attempts to subdue, immobilize or kill the former (according to a set of                        rules and guidelines), would very often, eventually, leave the fighter and audience feeling melancholic.                      From July 7-14 each year, thousands of people come to Pamplona town to witness or participate in Spain’s most                     famous bull-running fiesta. Good runners like to get close or run just ahead of the bull. They maintain their                     position as long as possible and when the bull begins to outrun them, they pull off to one side and let it pass by.                          The closer one gets to the bull, the bigger the risk. During one such run, I was able to touch a bull.                     250 The Tireless Traveler","Spain                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Europe    251","252 The Tireless Traveler","Switzerland                                                                                                                                         ‘The  Globe   of  Science  and                                                                                                                Innovation’ is designed to inform                                                                                                                visitors about the significant                                                                                                                research being carried out at CERN.

Located roughly                          A two hundred kilometers southeast of New Delhi, this                          former capital of the mighty Mughal Empire is universally                          famous for its magnificent white marble monument - the                          Taj Mahal.                           In 1962, Arvi joined the National Defense Academy in pursuit                          of his dream to serve in the army. However, his tenure ended                          abruptly, when while playing polo he had an accident, which                          led to loss of hearing in one ear. Subsequently, for nearly four                          years, Arvi worked at a tea plantation owned by a Scottish                          family in Darjeeling - a pristine hill-town located in the                          northeastern Himalayas.                           By 1970, Arvi was a partner in a garment manufacturing unit                          near Delhi. In 1975, he visited the United States for the first                          time to source business. Early successes led to subsequent                          trips, and Arvi took a liking to the American way of life. He                          applied for immigration and received his Green Card in 1977.                          By 1979, Arvi was an American citizen.
